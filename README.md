# Cuppa Comfort
## Introduction
Cuppa Comfort is a fictional family-owned coffee shop located in downtown Puyallup, Washington with plans to expand locations. They are in desperately in need of a website for better reach to their new local communities.    

This website is being built by myself, Teddy Bushnell, for my portfolio course at CPTC (WINTER 2024).
